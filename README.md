## Project Description

I was interested in doing something artsy and thought-provoking so I decided to make an app dedicated to the Rorschach inkblot test. It's an interesting way to see how people percieve images and understand that visual perception and meaning is unique to each person. Each person will have different meanings based on their personality. The simple question "what do you see?" is prompted when they look at an image and users will write their response based on each image.

I've decided to combine a React JS front-end with a MongoDB backend so everyone can actually look at each others' responses and it can be a community/social discussion. I'll also have a page where vistors can create and save their own inkblot! How fun.
